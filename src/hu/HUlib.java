// Revision 1.3  2011/02/11 00:11:13  velktron
// A MUCH needed update to v1.3.
//
// Revision 1.1  2010/06/30 08:58:51  velktron
// Let's see if this stuff will finally commit....
//
//
// Most stuff is still  being worked on. For a good place to start and get an idea of what is being done, I suggest checking out the "testers" package.
//
// Revision 1.1  2010/06/29 11:07:34  velktron
// Release often, release early they say...
//
// Commiting ALL stuff done so far. A lot of stuff is still broken/incomplete, and there's still mixed C code in there. I suggest you load everything up in Eclpise and see what gives from there.
//
// A good place to start is the testers/ directory, where you  can get an idea of how a few of the implemented stuff works.
